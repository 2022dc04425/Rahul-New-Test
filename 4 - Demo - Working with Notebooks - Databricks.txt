Demo: Working with Notebooks
Notebooks are the primary means of developing and executing code interactively on Databricks. This lesson provides a basic
introduction to working with Databricks notebooks.
Learning Objectives
1. Describe Databricks Notebooks as the most common interface for data engineers when working with Databricks.
2. Recognize common use cases for data engineers when working with Notebooks.
3. Create a new Notebook.
4. Write code in Notebook cells.
5. Run code in Notebook cells.
6. Write markdown-based notes in a Notebook.
7. Run code using multiple languages within the same Notebook.
8. Change the name of a Notebook.
9. Explore basic visualization capabilities in Databricks Notebooks.

Attach to a Cluster
In the previous lesson, you should have either deployed a cluster or identified a cluster that an admin has configured for you to
use.
At the top right corner of your screen, click the cluster selector ("Connect" button) and choose a cluster from the dropdown
menu. When the notebook is connected to a cluster, this button shows the name of the cluster.
NOTE: If your cluster is not running at the time you select it from the list, it will begin the startup process. Deploying a cluster can
take several minutes. A solid green circle will appear to the left of the cluster name once resources have been deployed.

Notebooks Basics
Notebooks provide cell-by-cell execution of code. Multiple languages can be mixed in a notebook. Users can add plots, images,
and markdown text to enhance their code.
Throughout this course, our notebooks are designed as learning instruments. Notebooks can be easily deployed as production
code with Databricks, as well as providing a robust toolset for data exploration, reporting, and dashboarding.

Running a Cell
Run the cell below using one of the following options:
Place your cursor in the cell, and type CTRL+ENTER or CTRL+RETURN
Place your cursor in the cell, and type SHIFT+ENTER or SHIFT+RETURN to run the cell and move to the next one
Click on the right-pointing triangle image in the upper-right corner of the cell and using Run Cell, Run All Above or Run
All Below as seen here

1.8 - Demo - Working with Notebooks - Databricks

Lesson Setup
Run the following cell. It will install a data file, called customers.csv , that we will use throughout this demo.

%run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-05

NOTE: Cell-by-cell code execution means that cells can be executed multiple times or out of order. Unless explicitly instructed,
you should always assume that the notebooks in this course are intended to be run one cell at a time from top to bottom. If you
encounter an error, make sure you read the text before and after a cell to ensure that the error wasn't an intentional learning
moment before you try to troubleshoot. Most errors can be resolved by either running earlier cells in a notebook that were
missed or re-executing the entire notebook from the top.

View customers.csv
Run the following cell to view the contents of customers.csv

display((spark.read
.csv(f"{DA.paths.datasets}/customers.csv")
))

Run a SQL Cell
As shown immediately to the right of this notebook's name, the default language for the notebook is Python. If we want to run a
SQL command in this notebook, we can start the cell with %sql . This is called a magic command.
Run the cell below. It contains a SQL command to view the contents of the same file as above.

%sql
SELECT * FROM csv.`dbfs:/mnt/dbacademy-datasets/get-started-with-data-engineering-on-databricks/v01/customers.csv`

Markdown
With the magic command %md we can render Markdown in a cell:
Double click this cell to begin editing it
Then hit Esc to stop editing

Title One
Title Two
Title Three
This is a test of the emergency broadcast system. This is only a test.
This is text with a bold word in it.
This is text with an italicized word in it.
This is an ordered list
1. one
2. two
3. three
This is an unordered list

Create a New Notebook
There are many ways to create a new notebook. If you are already in a notebook, perform the following:
1. Click the File menu and select New notebook
The notebook opens in a new tab.
2. Change the name of the new notebook to "My Notebook" by clicking the current name ("Untitled Notebook ...") in the upperleft corner
