1.6 - Demo - Working with Compute Resources
(https://databricks.com)

Demo: Compute Resources
In order to work with data in Databricks, we need to use compute resources (i.e.,
clusters and warehouses). In this demo, we will launch a new cluster and a new
warehouse.
Learning Objectives
1. Launch a new cluster.
2. Launch a new warehouse.

Create a Cluster
Depending on the workspace in which you're currently working, you may or may
not have cluster creation privileges.
Instructions in this section assume that you do have cluster creation privileges, and
that you need to deploy a new cluster to execute the lessons in this course.
NOTE: Check with your instructor or a platform admin to confirm whether or not
you should create a new cluster or connect to a cluster that has already been
deployed. Cluster policies may impact your options for cluster configuration.
Steps:
1. In the left sidebar, right-click on Compute and open the link in a new tab. This
will allow you to refer back to these instructions, as needed
2. Click the blue Create Compute button
3. For the Cluster name, use your name so that you can find it easily
4. Set the cluster to Single Node, to control costs for this testing cluster.
5. Set the Access Mode to Single User (this mode is required for Unity Catalog)
6. Use the recommended Databricks runtime version for this course
7. Leave boxes checked for the default settings under the Autoscaling Options
8. Note the configuration options available for clusters
9. Click the blue Create Compute button

1.6 - Demo - Working with Compute Resources - Databricks

NOTE: Clusters can take several minutes to deploy and startup. Once you have
finished deploying a cluster feel free to continue to explore the compute creation

Single User Cluster Required for This Course
IMPORTANT: This course requires you to run notebooks on a single user cluster.
Follow the instructions above to create a cluster that has Access mode set to
Single User .

Create a SQL Warehouse
Now that we have created a cluster, let's create a SQL Warehouse, so we can run
queries in Databricks SQL.
Steps:
1. Click on the tab, SQL Warehouses, on the Compute page
2. Click Create SQL warehouse
3. For the Name, use your name so that you can find it easily
4. Set the Cluster size to 2X-Small
5. Verify the Auto-stop is set to 10 minutes
6. Verify the Scaling is set to 1 for the Min. and 1 for the Max.
7. Verify that Type is set to Serverless
8. Note the Advanced options
9. Click Create

Conclusion
Now that we have created our compute resources, we can begin running
notebooks and queries.
